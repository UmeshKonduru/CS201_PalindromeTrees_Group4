**A.How to run**
1.eertree.c\n
Input:the terminal will prompt you to enter a string\n
Output:the program will give you all the distinct subpalindromes present in the string

2.jointeertree.c
Input:the terminal will prompt you to enter a strings until Q is pressed
Output:the program will give you all the distinct subpalindromes present in all the strings

3.pallen.c
Input:the terminal will prompt you to enter a string
Output:the program will give you the palindromic length of the string

4.quicklink.c (same as eerteree.c but the operations are a little faster )
Input:the terminal will prompt you to enter a string
Output:the program will give you all the distinct subpalindromes present in the string
